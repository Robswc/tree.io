# Tree.io
Tree.io is a collection of tools in the form of a python app.  The tools are represented by functions, files and classes and can be called with various parameters and arguments.

The majority of the tools focus on collecting and compiling data from wikipedia in helpful ways.  For example, need a quick family tree of the Royal Family? Want to plot major battles from WWII onto a live map?  Or perhaps even see how Ice Cream and frogs are related.  Tree.io can do that for you!

## How to use:

Currently, there is no UI for this.  You must go into tree.py and edit create_tree('topic', 1, 50) --- replacing 'topic' with whatever you wish to find a topic on.

You can then run create_newtwork.py, this will create a matplotlib plot.

Currently working on a plotly solution, which will make things smoother as plotly can handle many more datapoints!
